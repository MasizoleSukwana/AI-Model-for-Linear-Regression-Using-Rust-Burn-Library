# AI-Model-for-Linear-Regression-Using-Rust-Burn-Library
The goal of this assignment is to create a simple AI model for linear regression using the Rust programming
language and the burn library. The model should predict the output of the function y = 2x + 1 using
synthetic data for training. The programming language used to create the AI Model for linear regression is Python and this mini project is for exploring how to use, Rust Rover IDE, integrate it to GitHub to push, commit, write code, continuously update it and execute/debug it.


To run the project, the user needs to have a GitHub account, which can be created on the URL: https://github.com/
User needs to have access to the Repository/Project URL: https://github.com/MasizoleSukwana/AI-Model-for-Linear-Regression-Using-Rust-Burn-Library.git
After opening the Repo/Project URL, click the green "Code" button, open the dropdown arrow, and select CodeSpaces
Click the Add/Create codespaces icon for an environment to be created in the cloud
The CodeSpaces dev environment is prepared/set-up so that the user can run/execute the project
After the environment is prepared/set-up, on the Terminal tab, after this path: @MasizoleSukwana âžœ /workspaces/Masizole-Sukwana (main) $, user must type this code: python hello.py then press the Enter button, results are on the screenshot uploaded below
